# Handling Imbalanced Data: Techniques and Implementation
This repository contains examples and implementations of techniques for handling imbalanced datasets. Imbalanced data is a common issue in machine learning where one class is significantly more frequent than others, leading to biased models. This repository demonstrates how to address this problem using various techniques: oversampling, undersampling, and SMOTETomek.

### Techniques Covered
#### 1. Oversampling
Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class to balance the class distribution. This technique helps the model to learn better from the minority class data.
##### Common Oversampling Techniques:
NearMiss
        
    from imblearn.under_sampling import NearMiss
    from collections import Counter
    ns = NearMiss(sampling_strategy=0.8)
    X_train_ns, y_train_ns = ns.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
2. Undersampling
Undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class to balance the class distribution. This technique helps to address the imbalance by removing some instances from the majority class.

Common Undersampling Techniques:

Random Undersampling: Randomly removes instances from the majority class.
NearMiss: Selects instances from the majority class that are closest to the minority class instances.
Example:

python
Copy code
from imblearn.under_sampling import NearMiss
ns = NearMiss(sampling_strategy=0.8)
X_train_ns, y_train_ns = ns.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
3. SMOTETomek
SMOTETomek combines SMOTE and Tomek Links. SMOTE generates synthetic samples for the minority class, and Tomek Links cleans up the dataset by removing ambiguous instances close to the decision boundary.

Example:

python
Copy code
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTETomek
smote_tomek = SMOTETomek(sampling_strategy='auto', random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote_tomek.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
